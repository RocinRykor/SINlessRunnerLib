# SINlessRunnerLib

### IMPORTANT - Work In Progress

## Backend library of Shadowrun 3rd Edition, mainly for use in my character manager (SINlessRunner) and discord bots, but it will be available to those who wish to use it.

## Goals:
Contain all information surrounding in-game mechanics such as items and spells.
Contain information from supplemental books as well as CORE, such as Rigger 3, Magic in the Shadows, Matrix, etc.
Rules repo for quick lookup, including rule changes from supplemental books, such as changes to unarmed fighting from Cannon Companion.
Built in generators for creating systems on the fly, such as generating magical groups, matrix hosts with associated securities, npc stat blocks, etc.
Ability to quickly add in custom, homebrew, content.

## Progress:
### Everything listed here is in an extreme bare-bones state.
